            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE the Knights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the grief of our Hearts, the Popish Priests and Jesuits with the Papists, and their Adherents and Abetters have for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years last past pursued a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and hellish Plot, to root out the true Protestant Religion as a pestilent Heresie, to take away the Life of our Gracious King, to subvert our Laws and Liberties, and to set up Arbitrary power and Popery.</p>
            <p>And it being Notorious that they have been highly encouraged by the Countenance and Protection given and procured for them by <hi>J. D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> and by their Expectations of his succeeding to the Crown, and that through crafty Popish Councils his Designs have so far prevailed that he hath created ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great Dependents upon him by his bestowing Offices and Preferments both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>It appearing also to us, That by his Influence Mercenary Forces have been levied and kept on Foot for his secret Designs contrary to our Laws; the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102593:4"/>Officers thereof having been named and appointed by him, to the apparent hazard of His Majesties Person, our Religion and Government, if the danger had not been timely foreseen by several Parliaments, and part of those Forces with great difficulty, caused by them to be Disbanded at the Kingdoms great Expence: And it being Evident, that notwithstanding all the continual endeavours of the Parliament to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver His Majesty from the Councils, and out of the power of the said <hi>D.</hi> yet his Interest in the Ministry of State and others have been so prevalent, that Parliaments have been unreasonably Prorogued, and Dissolved when they have been in hot pursuit of the Popish Conspiracies, and ill Ministers of State their Assistants.</p>
            <p>And that the said <hi>D.</hi> in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all into his own power hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Garrisons, the Army and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and all the power of the Seas and Souldiery, and Lands belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these three Kingdoms to be put into the hands of his Party and their Adherents, even in opposition to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Order of the last Parliament.</p>
            <p>And as we considering with heavy Hearts how greatly the Strength, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Treasure of the Kingdom both at Sea and Land is Wasted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and lost by the intricate expensive management of these wicked destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Designs; and finding the same Councils after exemplary Justice upon some of the Conspirators, to be still pursued with the utmost devilish malice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Revenge; whereby His Majesty is in continual hazard of being Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to make way for the said <hi>D</hi>'s Advancement to the Crown, and the whole Kingdom in such case is destitute of all security of their Religion, Laws, Estates, and Liberty, sad experience in the Case, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> having proved the wisest Laws to be of little force to keep out Popery and Tyranny under a Popish Prince.</p>
            <p>We have therefore endeavoured in a Parliamentary way by a Bill for the purpose to Bar and Exclude the said Duke from the Succession to the Crown,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102593:4"/>and to Banish him for ever out of these Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the first Means of the King and Kingdoms Safety being utterly rejected, and we left almost in Despair of obtaining any real and effectual security, and knowing our selves to be intrusted to Advise and Act for the preservation of His Majesty and the Kingdom, and being persuaded in our Consciences that the dangers aforesaid are so eminent and pressing, that there ought to be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of the best means that are in our power to secure the Kingdom against them. We have thought fit to propose to all true Protestants an Union amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by solemn and sacred promise of mutual Defence and Assistance in the preservation of the true Protestant Religion, His Majesties Person and Royal State, and our Laws, Liberties and Properties, and we hold it our bounden Duty to joyn our selves for the same intent in a Declaration of our United Affections and Resolutions in the Form insuing,</p>

            <head>The Names of the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> for the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> who without stirring from the Bar, found the Bill of Indictment against the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> upon the single Testimony of <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> in open Court, a Prisoner at Bar then Arraigned; afterwards Codemned and Executed for High Treason.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> gave Evidence of what Monsieur <hi>Dupuy</hi> told him concerning the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> at <hi>Windsor;</hi> and that he saw the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> there come forth of a Room, and as the Earl went down Stairs he heard the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> say, <hi>That he would break the Heart of Sir</hi> Edmond-bury Godfrey; and declared that was all he could Witness against him. And going out of Court, he heard one of the Judges observe, <hi>That this whole Fact was in another County, and not inquirable by this Jury;</hi> whereupon he returned in haste back again and said <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury, I heard the Earl of</hi> Danby <hi>speak the same words at St.</hi> James, <hi>and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi> This was all the Evidence he gave to the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> of any Words or Fact in the County of <hi>Middlesex.</hi>
